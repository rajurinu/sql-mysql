SQL is the standard langyage used for accessing database.
It is used for retrieval and management of data in relational database.
SQL --> Structured Query Language.
It is known as the language for database, which is used to create, modify, deleting, fetching rows etc...
SQL is an ANSI(American National Standard Institute) standard but there are many different version of SQL.
All relational database system like Ms Access, SQL server, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL etc.. uses SQL as a language for accessing database.

Also they are using different dialects, such as:
  --> MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
  --> Oracle using PL/SQL,
  --> MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.
  
Why SQL?
--> Allows user to access data in relational database management system.
--> Allows user to describe the database.
--> Allows the user to define the data in database and manipulate the data.
--> Allows to embed within other language using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
--> Allows user to create and drop database and table.
--> Allows user to create view, stored procedure, functions in database.
--> Allows user to set permission on tables, views and procedures.

History:
--> 1970 -- Dr. Edgar F. "Ted" Codd of IBM is known as the father of relational databases. He described a relational model for 
    databases.
--> 1974 -- Structured Query Language appeared.
--> 1978 -- IBM worked to develop Codd's ideas and released a product named System/R.
--> 1986 -- IBM developed the first prototype of relational database and standardized by ANSI. The first relational database 
    was released by Relational Software and its later becoming Oracle.
    
SQL Process:
    Whenever we execute any SQL command for any RDBMS system, the sytem determines the best way to carry out the request and SQL engine figures out
    how to interpret the task.
    
    There are various componenet included in the process. These componenet are query dispatcher, Optimization Engines, Classic Query Engines,
    SQL query engine etc.
    Classic query engine handles all non-SQL queries but SQL query engine won't handle logical files.
    
The standard SQL command to interact with Database are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP.

These commands are classified in groups based on their nature:

1) DDL(Data Definition Language)
2) DML(Data Manipulation Language)
3) DCL(Data Control Lnguage)
